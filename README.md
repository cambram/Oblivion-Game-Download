## Description
In the 3rd year of my undergraduate degree, we had to create a game of our choice. Oblivion is a game focused on using light and darkness not only as deterrents for enemies but as weapons. The player is stranded in a cursed world consumed by darkness, with the sole objective of fighting through the dark to discover what lies ahead.

The player navigates the darkness with the help of a **flashlight**. However, the flashlight is unstable and requires batteries to function, which are scattered throughout the world. This adds a resource management challenge, ensuring the player has enough light to handle threats encountered along the way.
**Umbra** are the first enemies introduced. These creatures thrive in the cursed world, hiding in shadows and fearing light. The player uses their flashlight to repel Umbras, gaining a temporary sense of security as the flashlight's battery slowly runs out.

To counter this, a new item is introduced: the **Flash Charge**. These one-time-use items can be equipped to the flashlight and set off to kill all nearby enemies caught in its beam. This mechanic adds a layer of strategy to resource management and combat.

As the game progresses, the player discovers a **lantern**, which offers omnidirectional light to deter enemies from all sides. However, its beam is smaller, allowing Umbras to approach more closely. The lantern also supports flash charges however with a shorter range than the flashlight.

**Lux**, a new type of enemy, is introduced to vary gameplay. Unlike Umbras, Luxes are attracted to light and due to their very poor eyesight, they cannot see anything in the dark. Players can evade them by turning off their light and use a flash charge to eliminate them. The environment introduces unique mechanics to aid the player, for instance, lightning strikes can eliminate nearby enemies if used strategically. Similarly, falling logs serve as environmental traps. Players can lure Luxes into falling off ledges or use logs to save precious flash charges. And that is the gist of Oblivion.
